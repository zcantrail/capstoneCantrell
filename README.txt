Welcome to Zachary Cantrells capstone project.

This file is here to help whom ever may be looking through this code.

This website is built in nodejs therefore you will need to have this installed, but do not worry it is pretty easy.

Install nodejs
STEP 1! 
    go to this link here --> https://nodejs.org/en/ (this page will have two buttons for the download links, one ist lts, the other is the current.)
STEP 2!
    Click on which ever you prefer (This site is using current, so you will need that in order for this to work.)
STEP 3!
    Run the installer when its done dowloading, and follow instuctions. (pretty straight forward)
DONE!

Now that you have node lets open the project.
if you are like me and use vs code then open a new terminal and make sure you are inside the project folder.(\CapstoneProject-ZacCantrell)
Then simply run this command:

npm install 

this will install all of the packages that are used thought the site.(list of packes is in the package-lock.json file.)

Now host the application with the nodemon start script with this command:

npm start

Go to your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:7000
